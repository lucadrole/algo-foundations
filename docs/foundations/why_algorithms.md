# Why study Algorithms

An algorithms is a set of well-defined rules to solve some computational problem. In general, they are important to work in any area of CS.
Furthermore, algorithms are at the key of modern tech. A bulk of the advances in CS comes from algorithm improvements rather than from improvements in hardware.

However, the best pitch to algorithms is that they are fun and may make you a bit smarter.
