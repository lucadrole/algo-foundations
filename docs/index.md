# Algo Foundations

A structured exploration of classical algorithms and computational fundamentals.

These are my notes as I work through books and other resources.  
Everything here is a work in progress and mainly intended for my own use.

No text here is wrote by LLMs. I may use LLMs to check grammar and polish the format.

## Philosophy

I want to build a structured, evolving knowledge base rather than a collection of scattered notes.

The material is organized by topic, not by resource.
